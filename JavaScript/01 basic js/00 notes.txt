* static websites can be made with html + css
* JavaScript is a programming language.  
* Js add dynamicality in our website
* Js execute with the help of js engine that is present in every browerser e.g chrome - v8 engine
* in order to execute js in system we need a run time env called nodeJs which indirectly contains js engine.
* Modern js uses JIT (just in  time) compilation after interprtation so that it increases the speed of execution





* undefined - primtive value that automatically assigned that has been declare but not initialized and 
        also abssence of a value when property does not exist.
        all void function returns undefined e.g. console.log() returns undefined 

* null - null is primitive value that is intentional absence of any object value and explicitly assigned to a variable as no value

* js is a sychronus , single threaded , interpreted programming language.

synchronus - do not execute next line until and unless current line is executing 
            if there is error (not syntax error ) in next line it will come after execution of current line 

* in any execution context only var variables are initialized with undefined

* whenever we define a variable without using keyword var/let/const no matter where it is , it will be traeted as global variable.
