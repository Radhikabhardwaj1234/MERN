<!-- closures are related to nested function
lexical env or lexical scope is the scope of the  function's parent or grand parent 
* when  inner function try to find a variable from its lexical scope and found there then it will form a closure to that parent function through the variable 
* closure is an object which contains that variable for which it is searching 

below example will make two closure one for outer one for inner bcz a and b are in diffrent parent function.
Closure (inner)
b
: 
1
Closure (outer)
a
: 
0 -->
