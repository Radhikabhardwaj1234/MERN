<!-- var variables are having  global scope bcz they are part of window object -->
 <!--
 <script type = "module">  
    if we declare variable(var,let,const) in this it will store in to the module scope not in window object or global object so it will not be accessible outside the script.
    this is called module scope.

     Module scope : whatever is in this script it will execute and die with in this script only so we cannt access variables of this script in another script
